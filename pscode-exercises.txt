// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Get a and b values
sum=a+b
print sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

get a value for a
for a=a-2 until we get a=1 or a=0
if a=1 then print "Your number is ODD" else if a=0 then print "Your number is EVEN"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

get a, b, c, d, e
avg=(a+b+c+d+e)/5
if a<=b then min=a, max=b else min=b, max=a
if min>=c, max<=c then min=c, max=c 
if min>=d, max<=d then min=d, max=d
if min>=e, max<=e then min=e, max=e
if min=max then print "Your all numbers is same, average and minimum and maximum is " a 
print "Average for numbers" a,b,c,d,e " is equal to " avg ", minimum is " min ", maximum is " max
